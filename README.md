# Soup_Me_Up

Soup Me Up was created by a team of 3, 2 developers and 1 artist, as a submission for PaintJam2021.
The game is a puzzle "ball launcher" game where players will be launching a tomato into a can of soup across 12 (more levels to be added) levels.
Levels 1-6 serve as a tutorial for new players to understand the mechanics of the game.
Levels 7-12 contain mazes which serves as the "puzzle" for the player to solve in order to get the tomato into the soup can.
